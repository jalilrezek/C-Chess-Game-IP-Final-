Changes I made:

1) Reorganized the repo for easier readability. This required changes to the makefile so that it had access to each of the new directories. 
(I think this is okay for grading since it seemed like a suggestion to not change the makefile, but we can revert to the provided version it if not)
2) Added a gitignore so executables weren't uploaded to the repo
3) Updated the display to print out a full checkered board
4)Removed Unnecessary get_occ, clear_board, and delete_map functions
5)Added comments and indents for better style
6)Most up-to-date git log is here
7)Implemented and tested mystery.h, needed to tweak point_value and Piece.h for this(see Piazza post, this is ok now)
8)Wrote the README File
